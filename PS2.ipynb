    " - When you submit your code, make sure that every cell runs without returning an error.\n",
    " - Once you have the results you need, edit out any extraneous code and outputs.\n",
    " - *Do not rewrite code* if it doesn't need to be rewritten. For example, all the import statements you should need are in the first code block. Do not redo those in your analysis."

    "In this problem, you'll be comparing Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests in a task identifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous.\n",
    "The data is imported below and the features and feature values are listed. Notice, they're all letters.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Split the data into targets and features\n",
    " - Decide which features are ordinal or categorical. Refer to the feature descriptions on the [UCI Machine Learning site](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom) (hint: at least 3 categories are ordinal and others are binary...so you'll use an ordinal encoder)\n",
    " - Encode the features\n",
    " - Train the three models. You will want to use ```LogisticRegressionCV``` and ```GridSearchCV``` to find the best version of each model.\n",
    " - Make predictions with your models.\n",
    " - Show the confusion matrices for each type of model evaluated on the same test set. Label each figure clearly as to which model it is."

Also after emailing Professor Roth he said that the random forests model would be good for datasets that are missing data which is an issue with this one. \n",
